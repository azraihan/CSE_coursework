        Initialize the FourierSeries class with a target function, period L, and number of terms.
        
        Parameters:
        - func: The target function to approximate.
        - L: Half the period of the target function.
        - terms: Number of terms to use in the Fourier series expansion.

        Step 1: Compute the a0 coefficient, which is the average (DC component) of the function over one period.
        
        You need to integrate the target function over one period from -L to L.
        For that, you can use the trapezoidal rule with a set of points (N points here) for numerical integration.
        
        Parameters:
        - N: Number of points to use for integration (more points = more accuracy).

        You need to integrate the target function times cos(n * pi * x / L) over one period.
        This captures how much of the nth cosine harmonic is present in the function.
        
        Parameters:
        - n: Harmonic number to calculate the nth cosine coefficient.

        You need to integrate the target function times sin(n * pi * x / L) over one period.
        This determines the contribution of the nth sine harmonic in the function.
        
        Parameters:
        - n: Harmonic number to calculate the nth sine coefficient.
